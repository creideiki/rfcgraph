RFCGraph

Draws graphs of how all the IETF RFC:s relate to each other.

Requires Graphviz, AWK, a C++ compiler, Make, wget, and a connection
to <http://www.ietf.org/>.

If you don't want to run it yourself, there's an infrequently updated
public version at <https://www.lysator.liu.se/~creideiki/rfcgraph/>.

Run "make" once to fetch the list of RFC:s from IETF and build the
graph in text form.

Then run "make" again, with maximum parallelism (e.g
"make -j <number_of_processors>", or
"make -j `getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`" on Linux), to have Graphviz
draw lots of pictures. This will take a long time.

You'll end up with a whole lot of PNG files and an index.html file.
Move these to where your web server can read them, and look at
index.html with a web browser.

Lastly, run "make clean" to remove temporary files.

For an example of why you need this program, take a look at 0317.png.
This will also test your web browser's memory management subsystem.
